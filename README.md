# Text_summarization_using_Streamlit_and_Groq
This project demonstrates how to build a Streamlit-based text summarization app that leverages the Groq API for fast, high-performance inference of LLMs â€” all hosted within Google Colab. It enables users to upload documents, extract content, and generate concise summaries instantly, with a shareable web interface powered by ngrok.
